			<a href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim" target="_blank">Manim</a> is an
			animation engine for explanatory math videos. It was written by Grant
			Sanderson and popularized by his YouTube channel,
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/3blue1brown" target="_blank">
			3Blue1Brown</a>.

			Animating technical concepts is traditionally pretty tedious since it can
			be difficult to make the animations precise enough to convey them
			accurately. Manim uses Python to generate animations programmatically,
			which makes it possible to specify exactly how each one should look.

		<p>
			However, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/3b1b/manim/issues">
			manim is notoriously difficult to use</a>. This site is part of an ongoing
			effort both to make manim easily accessible through the web and to make it
			much easier to use.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is still very much a work in progress and any collaboration would be
			a huge help. Feel free to get in touch with me on the
